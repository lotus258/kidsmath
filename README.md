#Introduction about this app
This small web app is designed to generate the desired quanity (1-100) of random math equations for kids (5-7) to solve and feel confident. It offers 1, 2, 3 digits and +, -, * operators for selection to accommodate different kids math levels and interest. To keep it engaging for kids, different reward emojis are offered for kids to select.
